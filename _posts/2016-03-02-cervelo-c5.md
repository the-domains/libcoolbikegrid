## Cervelo C5

Winter. Well, it's March, and Spring is right around the corner. But, the roads are all chewed-up, full of pot-holes, and strewn with debris.

You want to ride. You want some speed. You want some suppleness as you head out on those early season rides.

Long distances. The equipped HED Ardennes come spec'd with Continental 28c tires, but riding with 30c tires is also possible. Taller head tubes, and built-in ride quality make this a perfect performance-oriented endurance road bike.
